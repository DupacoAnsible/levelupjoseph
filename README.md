- 👋 Hi, I’m @levelupjoseph
- 💞️ Finally reaching a stage in my transition from IT Operations into development where it is becoming more fun. Over the first mulhill, as I call challenges in my life. Or puzzles, which i'm taking a more liking to, recently. Thank you DG! It's a better and more positive outlook and approach to any situation at life and it was great advice. I will be writing a short story about the trials and errors of transitioning to devlops from IT Ops. I consider myself lucky to have been able to join the influential side of technology and become a leader in this full spectrum digital transformation of the modern day corporation.
