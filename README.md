- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @levelupjoseph
- Experiencing everday learning new information and doing something new as my career transitions into devops. I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to make this transition from a seasoned Architect in Enterprise IT and wearing multiple hats supporting customers of many Service Providers. I've made it over the first mulhill, as I had been used to calling challenges in my life. Or, as I like to express challenges now, puzzles. Thank you DG! It's a better and more positive outlook and approach to any situation at life and it was great advice.
